    In this webpage, we will learn about Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. 

    We will start with a simple example of a dog learning to find the bone in a 1D world.

    Then, we will explore a more complex example of a dog learning to find the bone in a 2D grid.

    Finally, we will explore Q-learning's application in economics pricing strategies.
